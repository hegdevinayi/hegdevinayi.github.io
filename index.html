    <p>Hello! I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="https://citrine.io">Citrine
      Informatics</a>, working on problems in materials informatics.</p>

    <p>Prior to joining Citrine, I was at Northwestern University pursuing a
    PhD in materials science.
    I worked on building <a href="http://oqmd.org">large databases of computed
      materials properties</a>, and using data-driven methods to discover new
    materials.
    You can find a list of my peer-reviewed publications on
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=arRehJwAAAAJ&hl">my
      Google Scholar profile</a>.</p>

    <p>I grew up mostly in the city of Bangalore, which has the best food on
    the planet (this is a fact).  In my free time, I enjoy biking, hiking,
    watching professional DotA, and reading novels. I maintain (poorly) a
    personal blog here.</p>
