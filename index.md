Hello! I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io),
working on problems in materials informatics.

Prior to joining Citrine, I was at Northwestern University pursuing a PhD in
materials science.
I worked on building [large databases of computed materials
properties](http://oqmd.org), and using data-driven methods to discover new
materials.
You can find a list of my peer-reviewed publications on [my Google Scholar
profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=arRehJwAAAAJ&hl).

I grew up mostly in the city of
[Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore), which has the best food
on the planet (this is a fact).
In my free time, I enjoy biking, hiking, watching professional DotA, and
reading novels. I have an ill-maintained personal blog here, where I write
about a potpourri of topics.
